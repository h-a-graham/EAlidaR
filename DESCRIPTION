Description: This package allows for the automated downloading of Environment Agency LiDAR composite (Raster) data for England via the DEFRA portal 
(https://environment.data.gov.uk/DefraDataDownload/?Mode=survey). The process is therefore much faster and allows for the integration of data download
into workflows.
